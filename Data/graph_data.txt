Ei pea hetkel meeles tippe, kus ta juba käinud on!

1. RANDOM GRAPHS?
2. SQUARE GRAPHS

2.1 both walk at the same time

one stays put

Problem:

If assuming a chessboard-like environment and that persons can find each other only if they end up in the same place, they never meet as they „change color“ with each step. As this is actually unlikely in real life for many reasons: first, the persons probably doesn’t move with the same speed and futhermore, when person A moves from place P1 to P2 and person B moves from place P2 to P1, they would probably see each ohter in that process, although there might be exceptions when intersection is really crowded or dark, for example.
